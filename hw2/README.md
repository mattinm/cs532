# Installation

From the root directory (the same directory as this file),
run the command `cmake .` followed by `cmake --build .`.

This will create the /build folder and populate it with the
binary for both `genome`.

This version allows the specification of the output filename,
the max N for the reads files, the max N for the chromosome
files, and multiple read and chr files.

Run ./genome -h for more information.
